    Plan:
    - Create sync function to sync each node to a particular time
    - Measure data 4x per day, and send to gateway
    - For pulse: measure time between pulses
    - Determine power to cover distance
        - Rerun power analysis
        - Do we want dynamic power to radio?

Memory Layout:

Total: 8 kilobytes

The first 8 bytes:

2 bytes: Measurement count
6 bytes: Unknown Currently

Could use this for 4 unsigned integers


Measurement             (20 bytes):
TimeStamp: 4 bytes      (unsigned long)
Number: 2 bytes         (unsigned int)
Moisture: 2 bytes       (unsigned int)
Temperature: 4 bytes    (float)
Humidity: 4 bytes       (float)
Light: 2 bytes          (unsigned int)
Battery: 2 bytes        (unsigned int)


How should we be sending data?
Maximum packet size of 255 bytes
Maybe we should be using a struct

Ok. 12 maximum measurements per packet.
